# AES-Encryption-128-bit
Overview - In this project, we will be implementing SPHINCS-Simpira. It is an alternative to the SPHINCS signature scheme, and we will also be using Simpira as a building block. SPHINCS is a hash-based signature scheme along with post-quantum security.  

Objective - So we plan to use SPHINCS, which is a post-quantum stateless hashing scheme along with AES 128. Such a kind of merger has not been done yet, and we are ourselves venturing into unknown grounds. 

Methodology - We will be analyzing and evaluating different algorithms with the one implemented by our team. The comparison of the algorithms will be done on the basis of the time taken by different algorithms to generate a key, security level of the algorithms and their performance.
This is a pure Python implementation of AES 128 bit, modified to work with under development post quantum keys.(This project is still under development.)
